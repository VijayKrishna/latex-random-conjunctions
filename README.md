latex-random-conjunctions
=========================

Distracted by thinking of alternate ways of saying things that like "Moreover" and "Therefore", in your scientific writing? Don't be! 
You can now focus on the stuff that really matters and leave the burden of figuring out the new ways to say some common place words with this latex package.

This project was largely inspired by [bgshiller's latex package: latex-therefore](https://github.com/bgschiller/latex-therefore). In many ways this project is a generalization of that idea.

To-be Supported Words/Phrases:

- [x] Therefore
- [x] Moreover
- [ ] For example
- [ ] However
